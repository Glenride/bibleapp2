                    question: "How do I start reading the Bible?",
                    answer: "Starting to read the Bible is simple with InspireWrite. Navigate to our Bible reader and begin with the Gospel of John if you're new to scripture—it's an accessible introduction to Jesus' life and teachings. Use our distraction-free Zen mode to focus on the text. Start with just one chapter a day, and use the highlighting and note features to capture insights as you read. Consistency matters more than quantity when building a Bible reading habit."
                },
                {
                    question: "Which Bible translation should I use?",
                    answer: "For new readers, we recommend starting with easy-to-understand translations like the New International Version (NIV) or New Living Translation (NLT). For deeper study, consider the English Standard Version (ESV) or New American Standard Bible (NASB). InspireWrite currently provides the King James Version (KJV), a classic translation known for its beautiful language and historical significance. The best translation is one you'll actually read consistently."
                },
                {
                    question: "Where should I start reading in the Bible?",
                    answer: "If you're new to the Bible, here are great starting points: The Gospel of John for understanding who Jesus is; The Book of Psalms for prayers and worship; Proverbs for practical wisdom; Genesis for the beginning of God's story. InspireWrite makes it easy to jump to any book—simply click on the book name from our homepage or use the navigation sidebar."
                },
                {
                    question: "How do I create a Bible reading habit?",
                    answer: "Building a Bible reading habit requires consistency and intention. Start small—even 5-10 minutes daily is powerful. Choose a specific time, like morning before work or evening before bed. Use InspireWrite's bookmarking feature to save your place. Set a reading plan goal, whether it's one chapter or a few verses per day. The highlight and note features help you engage more deeply, making reading more memorable and meaningful."

                    question: "How can I hear God's voice?",
                    answer: "Hearing God's voice often comes through Scripture—as you read the Bible, pay attention to verses that seem to speak directly to your situation. God also speaks through prayer (take time to listen, not just talk), through wise counsel from mature believers, through circumstances, and through the inner prompting of the Holy Spirit. InspireWrite's journaling feature helps you record these moments of insight and track how God has been speaking to you over time."
                },
                {
                    question: "What should I do when I feel far from God?",
                    answer: "Feeling spiritually dry is common and doesn't mean God has abandoned you. Continue your spiritual practices even when you don't feel like it—read Scripture, pray honestly about your feelings, stay connected to your faith community. Use InspireWrite to journal through this season; looking back at your notes later often reveals God's faithfulness. Consider reading Psalms of lament (like Psalm 42) which express similar feelings. Sometimes distance from God reveals areas where we've drifted that need attention."
                },
                {
                    question: "How do I pray effectively?",
                    answer: "Effective prayer isn't about using perfect words—it's about honest conversation with God. Start with thanksgiving, then confession, then bring your requests. The ACTS model helps: Adoration (praising God), Confession (acknowledging sins), Thanksgiving (expressing gratitude), and Supplication (making requests). Pray Scripture back to God—our AI features can help you identify key verses to pray over. Most importantly, make time to listen in silence, not just speak."
                },
                {
                    question: "How do I study the Bible deeply, not just read it?",
                    answer: "Deep Bible study involves observation (what does the text say?), interpretation (what does it mean?), and application (how does it change my life?). Use InspireWrite's highlighting to mark key themes in different colors. Write notes asking questions about the passage. Look up cross-references to see how passages connect. Our AI lesson generator can help you structure your study into formal insights. Consider joining a Bible study group for discussion and accountability."

                    question: "How does the AI sermon generator work?",
                    answer: "InspireWrite's AI sermon generator uses advanced language models to help you create structured sermons from Scripture. Select the verses you want to preach from using highlights or favorites, then click 'Generate Lesson.' The AI analyzes the passage and produces a structured sermon outline with introduction, main points, illustrations, and application. Review and edit the content—the AI is an assistant, not a replacement for your spiritual discernment and personal study."

                    question: "Can I share my sermons with others?",
                    answer: "Yes! InspireWrite allows you to share sermons you've created. From the sermon view page, click the 'Share' button to generate a shareable link. You can control whether the sermon is public or private. Share links with your congregation, small group, or fellow ministry leaders. Shared sermons display beautifully and can be accessed without an account."

                {
                    question: "How do I highlight and organize verses?",
                    answer: "To highlight a verse, simply click on it while reading. A color palette will appear letting you choose from yellow, green, blue, or pink. Each color can represent different categories—like promises, commands, prayers, or truths about God. Your highlights are saved automatically and appear in your dashboard for easy reference. Add notes to any highlight by clicking the note icon to capture your thoughts."
                },

                    question: "What is Zen mode?",
                    answer: "Zen mode is our distraction-free Bible reading experience. It removes navigation elements and visual clutter so you can focus entirely on God's Word. Enable Zen mode by clicking the Zen button while reading a chapter. The text expands to fill your screen with clean, readable typography. It's perfect for extended reading sessions, meditation on Scripture, or when you need to minimize distractions."
                },
                {
                    question: "How do I create and organize notes?",
                    answer: "Notes in InspireWrite are attached directly to verses, making them easy to find later. Click on any verse and select the note icon to add your reflection. Notes are saved in your dashboard under the highlights section. You can write prayers, record insights, track questions, or document how God is speaking to you. This creates a personal spiritual journal tied directly to Scripture."
